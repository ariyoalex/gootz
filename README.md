/* I must emphasize that hacking software, even if created for educational purposes, can be extremely dangerous and potentially illegal to use without proper authorization. If you are planning to use such software for testing purposes, please note that doing so without obtaining explicit permission from the targeted system or website's owner is illegal and could lead to serious legal consequences. <br>

Additionally, even if you do have permission to test a system, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and consequences of using hacking tools. These tools can potentially cause significant damage to the system or website you are testing, and could expose sensitive data or personal information in the process.<br>

Therefore, it is essential to proceed with caution when using hacking software, and to only use it in a controlled and authorized environment, such as a testing lab or a simulated environment. Always ensure that you have obtained explicit permission from the system or website owner before using any hacking tools, and that you are fully aware of the risks involved.<br>

Remember that the use of hacking tools for any illegal or malicious purpose is strictly prohibited and can result in severe legal consequences. */
